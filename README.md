# File-permissions

Description:

Python code to run on linux and macOS to find all files with insecure permissions. You could add in any mask value and find all files with their paths which are have permissions equal to or greater than the valie entered. 

Installation:
Its a simple python code, download this code, change the required path and mask value run it. 

Roadmap:
Currently it is a very straightforward code, I could work on creating a GUI to input values if anyone requests so. I would love to hear any feedback or reccomendations from you guys as well!
